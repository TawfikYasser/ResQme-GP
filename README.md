# ResQme-GP
# Background and Motivation
There is no doubt that road rescuing services are critical to any car driver. Despite its importance, there is a significant malfunction in the process of requesting a towing car in your current location. Many things can go wrong, starting from the wrong description of your current car’s location, the towing car’s driver accidentally arriving at the wrong location, or even you are in a situation where you don’t have a towing car’s services’ contact number, also you could get a flat tire, but you don’t have a spare one.

As a result, we decided to facilitate this whole process from contacting a towing car’s driver to delivering it to a car service centre and providing spare parts on the road if needed. Moreover, a user can deal directly with a car maintenance centre to send its facilities if the user does not want to deal with a random service.

# Proposed Solution

- Instead of manually searching for a car service center, or spare parts, this process takes a lot of time and may not lead to desirable results. In ResQme we’re helping car owners to find the nearest and best car service center and the best fit spare parts for the car using improved mobile application technology and enhancement algorithms.
- In ResQme we’re also using the data in the application to enhance the user experience to provide the most similar requirements for each specific user, by recommending the best-fit car service center and the good spare parts for that car based on the history of the user and considering other aspects.
- ResQme will be different in the way of providing the services, not only showing spare parts to users, but we’ll also be there step by step to provide the best experience of choosing the spare parts, best price, best quality for the user specifications.

# Project Objectives

- The main goal is to enhance the response time for road rescuing.
- Making the process of requesting a car service center easier and faster.
- Providing the ability to request spare parts.
- Requesting a towing car depending on the car owner’s location.
- Collecting and using the user’s data to enhance the user experience.

# Project Scope

- A mobile application that allows the customers and the service providers to register and use the app features.
- The broken car should be delivered to a car service center by the towing car. 
- The list of the Car maintenance center and the spare parts provided will be listed by the most recommended ones based on each user's data.
- Users should be able to rate the whole experience from requesting a towing car to the delivery of the car to the car maintenance center.
- Secondly, a web application for the system administrators to monitor the requests of the users, collect data and accordingly use and manipulate the data to help the system administrators gain some information about the application for future enhancements like where is the most road that cars break on.
- Deploy the backend on Google Firebase.
